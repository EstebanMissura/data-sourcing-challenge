Brief Description: Part 1 consisted of accessing the NYT API in order to create a list of titles. In Part 2, we accessed the TMDB API and used the previously mentioned titles list to find/query those in that website. Finally, we merged both dataframes in Part 3, cleaned up the data, and outputted/exported a csv with the finalized and merged dataframe.
